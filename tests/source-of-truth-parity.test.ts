/**
 * Source-of-truth parity canary — the enforcement of `inv.engineering.036`
 * ("one authoritative location per concern") and `inv.engineering.037` ("a
 * parallel implementation of an existing capability is a defect").
 *
 * Operator-ratified 2026-07-22, from the First Invariant Retrospective's
 * headline finding (IRL-017 §2.3): three independent defects in one session —
 * (a) EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY hand-duplicated as col_experiments markdown,
 * (b) the pack-corpus local-fs sniff duplicating the PACK_CORPUS_URL signal,
 * (c) ASSIGNABLE_EXPERIMENTS hand-duplicated from EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY —
 * were all violations of an ALREADY-canonical invariant. The gap was
 * enforcement, not doctrine. This file is the designated home for
 * source-of-truth parity checks: when a surface needs a projection of a
 * registry, DERIVE it in code; where derivation is impossible, add a parity
 * check HERE so drift fails the build instead of reaching production.
 *
 * Existing parity canaries that live elsewhere (indexed here, NOT duplicated —
 * that would itself violate 036):
 *  - EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY ↔ experiments/ disk directories:
 *      tests/constitutional-contracts.test.ts (disk-parity canary)
 *  - PACK_CORPUS_URL pins remote corpus mode over the local-fs sniff:
 *      tests/pack-corpus-store.test.ts (2026-07-22 incident contract)
 *  - PROTOCOL_FREEZE_ARTIFACT_KINDS ⊄ execution artifacts:
 *      tests/prd-epi-001-artifact-model.test.ts
