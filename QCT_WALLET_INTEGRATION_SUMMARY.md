## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Reusable Wallet Helpers Created

#### **MetaMask Helper** (`services/wallet/metamask.ts`)
- ✅ Wallet connection and account management
- ✅ Chain switching for all 5 EVM chains
- ✅ Transaction sending
- ✅ Native and ERC20 balance checking
- ✅ Event listeners for account/chain changes
- ✅ Supported chains:
  - Ethereum Sepolia (11155111)
  - Polygon Amoy (80002)
  - Optimism Sepolia (11155420)
  - Arbitrum Sepolia (421614)
  - Base Sepolia (84532)

#### **Phantom Helper** (`services/wallet/phantom.ts`)
- ✅ Wallet connection for Solana
- ✅ Transaction signing and sending
- ✅ SOL balance checking
- ✅ Message signing
- ✅ Event listeners for account changes
- ✅ Supported clusters: mainnet-beta, testnet, devnet

### 2. QCT Trading Card Enhanced

#### **New Features (Invisible Integration)**:
- ✅ Auto-detects MetaMask and Phantom on component mount
- ✅ Uses real wallet addresses instead of mock addresses
- ✅ Added Solana to supported chains (now 7 total)
- ✅ Seamless fallback if wallets not connected
- ✅ Chain-specific address routing (EVM → MetaMask, Solana → Phantom)

#### **Visual Enhancements**:
- ✅ Wallet status badges (right-justified on action row)
  - 🔗 EVM badge (emerald green) when MetaMask connected
  - ◎ SOL badge (purple) when Phantom connected
  - Hover shows full wallet address
  - Only visible when wallets are connected

#### **Styling Preserved**:
- ✅ ZERO changes to existing layout
- ✅ Same compact horizontal design
- ✅ Same colors, badges, buttons
- ✅ Same grid layout for balances
- ✅ Same quick action buttons (BTC → ETH, ETH → BTC)

## 🔧 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User opens Ops Console (`/ops`)
2. QCT Trading Card auto-checks for wallet connections
3. If MetaMask connected → Shows "🔗 EVM" badge
4. If Phantom connected → Shows "◎ SOL" badge
5. User selects chains and amount
6. Card automatically uses correct wallet address
7. User clicks trade → Real wallet addresses used

### Technical Flow:
```
Component Mount
    ↓
Check MetaMask (getAccounts)
    ↓
Check Phantom (getPublicKey)
    ↓
Set wallet addresses in state
    ↓
Load balances with real addresses
    ↓
User initiates trade
    ↓
Route to correct wallet based on chain type
    ↓
Execute trade with real addresses
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Local Testing (http://localhost:3000/ops):

#### **Test 1: Without Wallets**
1. Open Ops Console
2. QCT Trading Card should load normally
3. No wallet badges visible
4. Balances show mock data
5. Trading works with fallback addresses

#### **Test 2: With MetaMask**
1. Install MetaMask extension
2. Connect MetaMask to any EVM chain
3. Refresh Ops Console
4. Should see "🔗 EVM" badge (emerald green)
5. Hover badge to see your address
6. Select EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
7. Balances should use your MetaMask address

#### **Test 3: With Phantom**
1. Install Phantom extension
2. Connect Phantom wallet
3. Refresh Ops Console
4. Should see "◎ SOL" badge (purple)
5. Hover badge to see your Solana address
6. Select Solana chain
7. Balance should use your Phantom address

#### **Test 4: With Both Wallets**
1. Connect both MetaMask and Phantom
2. Refresh Ops Console
3. Should see both badges: "🔗 EVM" and "◎ SOL"
4. Test cross-chain trading (e.g., Ethereum → Solana)
5. Should use correct addresses for each chain
