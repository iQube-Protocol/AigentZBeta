# Progress Report – QCT Ops & DVN
Date: 2025-10-12
Repo: iQube-Protocol/AigentZBeta (branch: dev)

## Snapshot
- 7-chain scope (BTC testnet, 5 EVM testnets, Solana testnet). Total supply target 0.4B Q¢.
- Live DVN/PoS path operational: `cross_chain_service` (DVN) → `proof_of_state` (PoS) → `btc_signer_psbt` (BTC anchor).
- Production DVN canister: `sp5ye-2qaaa-aaaao-qkqla-cai` (replaced missing id). Auth fixed via identity (DFX_IDENTITY_PEM).

## Frontend & APIs
- Live routes/hooks: ETH Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, DVN status. No mock policy applied.
- Cross-chain API flattened → UI shows 7 chains correctly.
- Cards refined: Trading/Treasury/Overview/Analytics/Event Register (spacing, quick amounts, collapsed header, right-aligned actions, consistent formatting).

## Hybrid Processing (3-tier policy)
- Tier 1: Fast-track high-value → immediate DVN→PoS→BTC anchor (individual receipts).
- Tier 2: DVN→PoS drift batching → when drift > 10, auto-batch anchor pending DVN items.
- Tier 3 (planned): Server-side batching in Next.js → append-only logs → Merkle root → DVN BatchCommit → PoS anchor → purge; retain audit index + proof API.

## Verifiability (today)
- All surfaced events originate from on-chain or canister state (txids, receipts). Next.js currently aggregates but does not batch/anchor.

## Roadmap (next)
- Implement server tx log, Merkle batcher, DVN BatchCommit, PoS batch receipts, audit/proof APIs, purge policies, governance thresholds & dashboards.
