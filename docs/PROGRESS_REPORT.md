# Aigent Z Progress Report (Inception â†’ Current)

Date: 2025-09-22 (Updated)

## Executive Summary

Aigent Z has evolved from an initial exploratory agent UX into a working Next.js Registry experience that supports discovering iQube templates, saving to a private Library, minting to a server-backed Registry with explicit Public/Private controls, and a tidy UI with clear badges and controls. The current release stabilizes the minting flow, improves the Registry header and filtering ergonomics, and documents operational behaviors for operators.

## Scope and Objectives

- Build an iQube Registry UI that supports browsing, filtering, saving, and minting iQubes
- Clarify privacy semantics across Library (local/private) and Registry (server/public/private)
- Move to server-first state for critical gating while retaining responsive client UX
- Provide durable backups and a documented restore path

## Timeline of Major Milestones

1. Initial Sidebar and Submenu Workflows
   - Implemented multi-tab iQube operations (View, Use, Edit, Decrypt, Mint, Activate)
   - Resolved JSX structural bugs in `components/SubmenuDrawer.tsx` (see memory notes), stabilized collapse/expand patterns
2. Registry Foundation
   - Built Registry grid/list/table views with filter controls and badges
   - Established scoring visualization rules for card/table displays
3. HTTP/API Refactor (Phase A)
   - Introduced Next.js API routes under `app/api/registry/*` to move UI data flow to HTTP
   - Laid groundwork for Supabase-backed persistence without changing UI interfaces
4. Minting UX Stabilization (Current Cycle)
   - Confirm dialog for visibility choice (Public/Private) before minting
   - Server-first mint gating via `template.visibility`; Library-only local flag retained for UX
   - Hydration-safe visibility logic to avoid SSR/CSR mismatches
   - UI refinements: iconized view toggle, aligned Registry header, centered labels
5. Operations, Backup, and Restore
   - Local timestamped backups including build artifacts
   - Added `scripts/restore_from_backup.sh` and README restore guide
6. **Cross-Chain Operations Console (September 2025)**
   - Implemented comprehensive Ops Console at `/ops` for monitoring cross-chain infrastructure
   - Built live monitoring for ICP canisters, EVM networks (Sepolia/Amoy), BTC testnet, and Solana devnet
   - Created DVN (Decentralized Verifier Network) monitoring with LayerZero integration
   - Established MetaMask transaction creation and monitoring workflows
7. **EVM Transaction Monitoring & BTC Integration (September 2025)**
   - Fixed DVN canister dependency issues with comprehensive fallback system
   - Implemented reliable BTC testnet monitoring with dual-API approach
   - Resolved anchor functionality diagnostics and error handling
   - Enhanced cross-chain transaction monitoring with graceful degradation

## Completed Work (What and How)

- Mint Flow and Gating
  - Implemented application notice using `components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx` from `IQubeDetailModal`
  - Server visibility (`template.visibility`) determines minted state
  - Local `library_<id>` enables minting for templates saved privately
  - Post-mint: close modal, clear local `library_<id>`, notify grid via `registryTemplateUpdated`
- Hydration Safety
  - Shifted `localStorage` access into `useEffect` and derived `canShowMint` client-side only
- Badging and Labels
  - `Library (Private)` replaces generic "Library" badge in `components/registry/IQubeCard.tsx`
  - Registry badges: `Registry (Public)` / `Registry (Private)` reflect server visibility
- Registry Header and Filters
  - `components/registry/ViewModeToggle.tsx`: switched to lucide-react icon buttons (Grid/List/Table)
  - `components/registry/RegistryHome.tsx`: aligned right-side icons and cart pill on one row
  - `components/registry/FilterSection.tsx`: center-aligned labels and date buttons
- TypeScript and Build Health
  - `app/api/registry/similarity/route.ts`: typed arrays and callbacks, fixed Set iteration via TS target
  - `tsconfig.json`: target `es2017`, exclude `backups/` and nested duplicates
  - `app/registry/page.tsx`: wrapped with `Suspense` for `useSearchParams`
  - `components/Sidebar.tsx`: fixed undefined identifiers in navigation helper
- Documentation
  - README: Added "Recent Work: Minting UX/UI and Library Behavior" and "Restore from Backup"
  - `docs/OPERATORS_MANUAL.md`: Detailed operator behavior for Library vs Registry, Public vs Private, mint flow
- Backups and Git Hygiene
  - Created full tarball backups in `backups/<timestamp>/AigentZBeta_full.tar.gz`
  - `.gitignore` updated to exclude `backups/` to avoid large file pushes
- **Cross-Chain Operations Infrastructure**
  - Built comprehensive Ops Console with real-time monitoring capabilities
  - Implemented API routes for all supported networks: `/api/ops/{btc,ethereum,polygon,dvn,solana,crosschain}`
  - Created React hooks for live data fetching with configurable refresh intervals
  - Added MetaMask integration for transaction creation and chain switching
- **DVN Transaction Monitoring System**
  - Implemented DVN monitoring with fallback system for canister failures
  - Created local transaction tracking when DVN canister is unavailable
  - Built transaction receipt querying via public RPC endpoints
  - Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **BTC Integration and Reliability**
  - Implemented dual-API approach for BTC testnet (mempool.space + blockstream.info)
  - Added client-side caching for block height persistence during API outages
  - Fixed canister ID mismatches and environment configuration issues
  - Enhanced anchor functionality diagnostics with detailed error reporting

## Key Problems Encountered and Resolutions

- Next.js Hydration Errors
  - Cause: Reading `localStorage/window` in SSR branches
  - Fix: Compute client-only state in `useEffect` and render derived booleans
- Inconsistent Mint Button Visibility
  - Cause: Mixing local minted flags with server visibility
  - Fix: Gate solely on `template.visibility`; use local library flag only to enable mint from saved drafts
- JSX Structural Breakages in `SubmenuDrawer`
  - Cause: Mis-nested JSX
  - Fix: Corrected indentation and structure; added collapse/expand logic consistently
- Build Failures from Archived Code
  - Cause: TypeScript compiling under `backups/` and nested copies
  - Fix: Exclusions in `tsconfig.json`
- CSR Bailout on `/registry`
  - Cause: `useSearchParams` without Suspense
  - Fix: `Suspense` wrapper with `RegistryPageInner`
- GitHub Push Blocked by Large Files
  - Cause: Attempted to push local tarball backups
  - Fix: `.gitignore` excludes `backups/`; amended commit and pushed cleanly
- **DVN Canister Dependency Issues**
  - Cause: DVN canister compiled with outdated dependency canister IDs, causing `canister_not_found` errors
  - Fix: Implemented comprehensive fallback system using local RPC queries when canister calls fail
- **BTC Testnet API Reliability Issues**
  - Cause: Single API endpoint (mempool.space) experiencing timeouts and rate limiting
  - Fix: Implemented dual-API approach with blockstream.info fallback and client-side caching
- **Canister ID Mismatches**
  - Cause: Environment variables contained outdated canister IDs from previous deployments
  - Fix: Updated `.env.local` with correct live canister IDs and restarted development server
- **Anchor Functionality Missing Methods**
  - Cause: proof_of_state canister deployed with incomplete IDL (missing issue_receipt, batch, anchor methods)
  - Fix: Enhanced error handling to show available methods and provide clear diagnostic information

## Current Architecture Snapshot

- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn-ui
- UI Modules: `components/registry/*` (cards, filters, view toggles, modal)
- API Routes: `app/api/registry/*`, `app/api/core/*`, `app/api/dev/user`, `app/api/ops/*`
- Persistence: Transitional; server visibility persists via API (Supabase-ready)
- Client State: Local library and active flags in `localStorage` for responsiveness
- **Cross-Chain Infrastructure**: ICP canisters, EVM networks, BTC testnet, DVN monitoring
- **Operations Console**: Real-time monitoring at `/ops` with live data feeds and transaction creation

## Detailed Project TODO (Backlog)

- Server-Driven State & Ownership
  - Migrate more local flags (minted/owner/active) from `localStorage` to server fields
  - Ensure ownership checks on server before enabling mint in view mode
- Real-Time UI Consistency
  - Standardize `registryTemplateUpdated` or adopt SWR/invalidation for registry views
- Operator & Audit Enhancements
  - Add event/audit trails for mint/save/fork operations
  - Expose admin analytics views (extend `app/api/registry/analytics`)
- UX Refinements
  - Optional divider between view icons and cart pill, fine-grained spacing polish
  - Continue label and input alignment passes for pixel-perfect layout
- CI/CD & Quality Gates
  - Add GitHub Actions for lint/build/test
  - Add E2E smoke for minting flow (Playwright) and lint markdown (markdownlint)
- Authentication & Access Control
  - Wallet/session auth and capability tokens
  - RLS policies in Supabase for per-user visibility
- Documentation & Developer Experience
  - Add Makefile targets: `backup`, `restore`, `dev`, `build`
  - Expand `OPERATORS_MANUAL.md` with screenshots/workflows
- **Cross-Chain Infrastructure Improvements**
  - Redeploy proof_of_state canister with full anchor functionality (issue_receipt, batch, anchor methods)
  - Redeploy DVN canister with correct dependency canister IDs
  - Add fallback implementations for DVN attestation and verification routes
  - Implement end-to-end transaction flow from EVM â†’ DVN â†’ BTC anchoring
- **Operations Console Enhancements**
  - Add transaction history and audit trails
  - Implement automated health checks and alerting
  - Add performance metrics and monitoring dashboards
  - Create operator guides for troubleshooting common issues

## Remaining Work (for Program Alignment)

- Backend Integration (Phase B)
  - Switch Next API internals to Supabase with RLS; maintain UI contract
  - Implement full CRUD and visibility transitions (private â†” public)
- Ownership & Permissions
  - Server-enforced owner checks (who can mint/save/fork)
  - Activation pathways from private â†’ public with audit logging
- Observability
  - Structured logs and metrics for API routes
  - Frontend logging for key flows (minting, library changes)
- Hardening & Scale
  - Progressive caching strategies, pagination for large registries
  - Performance budgets for SSR/CSR interactions

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Local flags diverge from server state during migration
  - Mitigation: Prioritize server fields for gating; emit refresh events after mutations
- Risk: UI regressions from hydration or API changes
  - Mitigation: Add SSR-safe patterns (all localStorage reads in effects), add testing
- Risk: Data privacy mislabeling
  - Mitigation: Clear visual language (`Library (Private)`, `Registry (Public/Private)`), operator docs

## Next 2-Week Plan (Suggested)

- Week 1
  - Server-driven state for ownership and visibility
  - SWR-based fetch/invalidation for registry lists
  - CI pipeline: lint, build, minimal tests
- Week 2
  - Add activation flow for private â†’ public
  - Expand analytics route + UI panels
  - Operator manual screenshots & Makefile utilities
